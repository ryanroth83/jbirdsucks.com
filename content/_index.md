Let’s clear things up: Jbird doesn’t actually suck.  
He just **sucks at being average**.  

### *Is Jbird real?*
Yes.  

### *Is he myth?*
Also yes.  

### *Does he own more than one pair of cargo shorts?*
I'm not legally allowed to disclose that.

### Inside you'll find:
- **Unbiased** evidence of Jbird's so-called “suckage”  
- **High-definition** images of his face on things it doesn't belong  
- **100% factual** fake testimonials  
- And a growing **collection of GIFs** that are definitely not Photoshopped
